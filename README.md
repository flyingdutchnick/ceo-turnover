# Predicting CEO turnover

Inevitably, over the life of a company, CEOs are hired and replaced. Here are some headlines from the past three months: 

- "Tidjane Thiam is forced out of Credit Suisse after a spying fiasco."

- "A hard act to follow: Bob Iger leaves Disney."

- "Should Jamie Dimon, Wall Streetâ€™s most celebrated boss, call it a day?"

- "Talk of succession atop Big Tech grows louder: giants including Salesforce, Apple and Microsoft may get new bosses in the next year or two"

A new HBO series called Succession dramatizes the events surrounding some CEO transitions: confusion among shareholders about the direction of the company, uncertainty for employees and a CEO's team, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and an increased risk of becoming a takeover target.  Not all CEO transitions have as a high a dose of drama as portrayed in Succession, but these events are far from unusual. Many a CEO transition has gone bad. 

What if a CEO transition or crisis could be predicted before it emerges? If boards could predict turnover events, they might be able to prevent minor problems from blowing into major crises, or they might be able to accelerate planning for a successor. Recent advances in AI and cloud computing have removed constraints and make it possible to do this type of analysis at low cost, while following widely-available recipes. 

This project seeks to explore how we can use off-the-shelf analytics tools like the powerful XGBoost model along with publicly available data to predict a CEO turnover event before it happens. Specifically, we want to predict the following question:

   **Will a CEO leave his or her job in the next 12 months? TRUE or FALSE**

Below we describe our data used, our methodology, the results of our model and some suggested next steps.

### Data

Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) was used in preparing this predictive model of CEO turnover. This service and the data available thereon constitute valuable intellectual property and trade secrets of WRDS and/or its third-party suppliers. Our dataset contains the following variables. 

**Director data:**

- Date of birth
- Company name
- Role title
- Role start date
- Role end date
- Gender

**Performance data:** 

- Company name, ticker
- Date (year, month)
- Closing price

### Next steps: dealing with ethical dilemmas

The possibilities offered by AI are exciting. Through online courses, cloud services and chat forums, models that were once only applied by PhDs with degrees in econometrics or computer science are now being applied by guys in a basement on AWS. But for companies, there are serious ethical issues involved. In the case of predicting CEO turnover, we used publicly available data, but if boards wanted, they could enhance the power of these models by using proprietary company data as an input. They could mine the communications of a CEO and their deputies along with the emails of everyone else in the company. This raises ethical questions. Importantly, companies can get ahead of looming "AI dilemmas" by asking themselves the following questions: 

- Is the company's use of AI completely compliant with current (and likely future) laws and regulations? 
- Can the company explain what it is doing with AI and how its use of AI is fair and aligned with stakeholder expectations?
- Do we understand potential biases of our models? If so, how do we ensure checks and balances? 
- Do people who are affected by AI have a voice in the development process and a way to ensure their voice is heard?

We don't expect companies have all the answers ready, but we think it's the responsibility of all boards to proactively debate these issues, understand the implications of AI and develop standards for the fair use of AI framework to ensure AI is used responsibly. Given the rapid progress in AI, boards should start these discussions today.
